# Hello, world!

Today, we're going to be making our first changes to HTML.

## Requirements

- [ ] Change the title of the page to Hello, world!
- [ ] Add a paragraph in the first line of the body tag with the text "Hello, world!", using the `<p>` tag.
- [ ] Add another paragraph telling us who you are, and what you're looking forward to most in this class.
- [ ] After class, choose one HTML element that interests you from [the MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to introduce to the class. Use the snippet below to get started:
	```
		<h2>My favorite new HTML element</h2>
		<!-- This is a comment. It helps provide instructions, and doesn't show in final HTML. You can delete it if you want, and replace this with what your favorite HTML element is, and why. Hint: if you want to show your HTML element like a tag in the text, like in the example, you may need to escape the HTML element using a tool like https://www.freeformatter.com/html-escape.html -->
		<h3>How to use this element</h3>
		<code>
			<!-- Try adding an example of how to use your HTML element here. You can use MDN's examples as a starting point. -->
		</code>
		<p>All information is from <cite><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">MDN docs</a></cite></p>
	```
- [ ] Send a link to your completed project in Glitch in the #introductions channel in Slack.

## Get started by syncing with Glitch!

First time? Need some extra help getting set up? Check out [this tutorial video on Kaltura](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n).

Just need a quick refresher? [Try this part of the video instead.](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=783)

**Import this repository to your Glitch account**
- Copy the URL of this repository, then open [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) in a new tab.
- Click "New Project", then "Import from Github".
- Paste the URL of this repository into the dialog.
- Rename the project to something you will remember, like this repository name.

A new Glitch project with this code will appear. Now, you should set up the export so that when you're done editing in Glitch, Github will be able to see your changes, and you can check to see if you met the assignment requirements. This is the perfect time to test that connection.

**Export your changes from Glitch to Gibhub**
- Click "Tools" at the bottom of the page, and then click "Import and Export".
- Click "Export to Github".
- Return to this tab and grab your repository name. For example, `ProfessorKolodziej/example-assignment`.
- You're ready to work! When you're happy with what you have, export your changes, and then return to Github and [create a pull request](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=640) from the new branch Glitch creates. Your grading and feedback will happen here!
- Don't forget to [submit your pull request to Blackboard](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=825) when you're ready for my feedback.

## How grading and feedback works

This repository uses Autograding to check the basic assignment requirements. Once you pass these requirements, [send me a link to the pull request in Blackboard](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=825). I'll give you additional feedback on things like performance and coding style, so you know how to improve your code for next time.

[Learn more about Autograding in this video](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=676)
